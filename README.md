## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

Step 1: Set up your Stripe account
Sign up for a Stripe account at https://dashboard.stripe.com/register.
Get your API keys from the Stripe dashboard. You'll need the publishable key and the secret key.

Step 2: Set up the backend (Node.js)
Create a new Node.js project and install the required dependencies, such as express, stripe, and dotenv.
Create an API endpoint in your Express server to handle payment requests from the client.
In your API endpoint, initialize the Stripe client using your secret key.
Implement the necessary logic to create a payment intent or process payments using Stripe's APIs. This may involve validating the request, calculating the payment amount, and handling any additional requirements specific to your application.
